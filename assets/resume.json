I have experience in backend development in banking, tourism, gambling,  e-commerce and logistics. I'm really excited about Scala/Akka stack, but I also like functional programming with Java 8 and Spring framework. The choice of programming language is not important for me, although I strongly prefer typed languages.  Now I'm switching my career to product management and leadership. I'm a team leader of distributed group of developers. I organize the process,  plan sprints, transform business needs into technical requirements, choose technology, actively develop code in initial stages, pay  extra attention to code review and integration testing, configure infrastructure and pipelines. My main language is Scala and I have  experience with Java, Python, C#, Javascript/Typescript. I have basic understanding of machine learning techniques and NLP. And I still  remember some algorithms. I prefer real-world product development with real customers. I studied physics at university (Bachelorâ€™s Degree)  which gave me solid math background and model thinking.\n","location":{"address":"Silicon Oasis","city":"Dubai","countryCode":"UAE"},"profiles":[{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"Nikita Panteleev","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikita-panteleev-45607973/"},{"network":"","username":"CV.pdf","url":"/assets/Nikita Panteleev (Team Lead, Scala, Java) CV.pdf"}]},"work":[{"company":"Logistics start up","position":"Head of IT","website":"","startDate":"2017-06-20","endDate":"","summary":"Managing distributed team of developers.
