I have experience in backend development in banking, tourism, gambling,  e-commerce and logistics. I'm really excited about Scala/Akka stack, but I also like functional programming with Java 8 and Spring framework. The choice of programming language is not important for me, although I strongly prefer typed languages.  Now I'm switching my career to product management and leadership. I'm a team leader of distributed group of developers. I organize the process,  plan sprints, transform business needs into technical requirements, choose technology, actively develop code in initial stages, pay  extra attention to code review and integration testing, configure infrastructure and pipelines. My main language is Scala and I have  experience with Java, Python, C#, Javascript/Typescript. I have basic understanding of machine learning techniques and NLP. And I still  remember some algorithms. I prefer real-world product development with real customers. I studied physics at university (Bachelor Degree)  which gave me solid math background and model thinking.\n","location":{"address":"Silicon Oasis","city":"Dubai","countryCode":"UAE"},"profiles":[{"network":"LinkedIn","username":"Nikita Panteleev","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikita-panteleev-45607973/"},{"network":"","username":"CV.pdf","url":"/assets/Nikita Panteleev (Team Lead, Scala, Java) CV.pdf"}]},"work":[{"company":"Logistics start up","position":"CTO","website":"","startDate":"2017-06-20","endDate":"","summary":"I joined logistics startup at early stage. I introduced agile practices for distributed team of developers  (jira, scrum sprints, code review on gitlab), wrote docker builds for java, javascript, php and android builds. Configured gitlab pipelines  with DCOS (docker orchestration). Configured network rules (cloudflare, marathon, nginx) and deployment without downtime. Added  testing environments. Improved java code by introducing java 8 collections, scala-like collection (jOOL), lombok. I added spring security, spring jpa + hibernate optimization, QueryDsl and REST data. For frontend I introduced typescript and ionic development. Although these 6 months were intensive  from development and management perspective, the business side was way behind the tech.\n","highlights":["Technology improvement","Product delivery in time"]},{"company":"noon.com","position":"Scala Developer","website":"https://www.noon.com","startDate":"2016-12-25","endDate":"2017-05-20","summary":"Delivering business features in fast-growing e-commerce startup, managing remote contractors, supporting existing infrastructure.
